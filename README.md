# Messed up a final round interview today for an amazing cruise line
I got stuck on JSON data from an API that had a lot of nested objects.
It was definitely a learning experience. The sad thing though, it was only that part that really messed me up.
So I looked up how to destructure objects after the interview, and it was definitely a facepalm moment.
I was able to code everything else quickly after figuring out how to properly deal with the data though.
